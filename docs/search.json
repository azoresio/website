      "contents": "\nAzores is a place for free thinkers, creative minds, and challengers\nof the status quo. We recognize the chaos and complexity of big, global\nissues, and seek to explore them with humility, and data. We accept that\nneat, perfect solutions for ‘transformational change’ are mostly\nunavailable, and that imperfect, uncomfortable compromises are necessary\non the quest for sustainability. We strive to create an inclusive\ncommunity with a multitude of voices for positive and constructive\nexchange.\nWe believe that sanitation is an overlooked and underfunded tool\nwithout which there can be no public or environmental health. We share a\nvision of a vibrant, innovative, global sanitation economy, to unlock\nsocial, environmental and economic benefits for the world’s most\nvulnerable populations and ecosystems. We keep our heads up and our eyes\nwide open for new ideas, new synergies, and new partners.\n\n\n\n",

The purpose of this License is for the Licensor named above\nto permit the Licensee (as defined below) broad permission, if\nconsistent with Human Rights Laws and Human Rights Principles (as each\nis defined below), to use and work with the Software (as defined below)\nwithin the full scope of Licensor’s copyright and patent rights, if any,\nin the Software, while ensuring attribution and protecting the Licensor\nfrom liability.\nPermission and Conditions. The Licensor grants permission by this\nlicense (“License”), free of charge, to the extent of Licensor’s rights\nunder applicable copyright and patent law, to any person or entity (the\n“Licensee”) obtaining a copy of this software and associated\ndocumentation files (the “Software”), to do everything with the Software\nthat would otherwise infringe (i) the Licensor’s copyright in the\nSoftware or (ii) any patent claims to the Software that the Licensor can\nlicense or becomes able to license, subject to all of the following\nterms and conditions:\nAcceptance. This License is automatically offered to every person\nand entity subject to its terms and conditions. Licensee accepts this\nLicense and agrees to its terms and conditions by taking any action with\nthe Software that, absent this License, would infringe any intellectual\nproperty right held by Licensor.\nNotice. Licensee must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any\npart of this Software from Licensee, with or without changes, also\nreceives the License and the above copyright notice (and if included by\nthe Licensor, patent, trademark and attribution notice). Licensee must\ncause any modified versions of the Software to carry prominent notices\nstating that Licensee changed the Software. For clarity, although\nLicensee is free to create modifications of the Software and distribute\nonly the modified portion created by Licensee with additional or\ndifferent terms, the portion of the Software not modified must be\ndistributed pursuant to this License. If anyone notifies Licensee in\nwriting that Licensee has not complied with this Notice section,\nLicensee can keep this License by taking all practical steps to comply\nwithin 30 days after the notice. If Licensee does not do so, Licensee’s\nLicense (and all rights licensed hereunder) shall end\nimmediately.\nCompliance with Human Rights Principles and Human Rights\nLaws.\nHuman Rights Principles.\nLicensee is advised to consult the articles of the United Nations\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Global\nCompact that define recognized principles of international human rights\n(the “Human Rights Principles”). Licensee shall use the Software in a\nmanner consistent with Human Rights Principles.\nUnless the Licensor and Licensee agree otherwise, any dispute,\ncontroversy, or claim arising out of or relating to (i) Section 1(a)\nregarding Human Rights Principles, including the breach of Section 1(a),\ntermination of this License for breach of the Human Rights Principles,\nor invalidity of Section 1(a) or (ii) a determination of whether any Law\nis consistent or in conflict with Human Rights Principles pursuant to\nSection 2, below, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the\nHague Rules on Business and Human Rights Arbitration (the “Rules”);\nprovided, however, that Licensee may elect not to participate in such\narbitration, in which event this License (and all rights licensed\nhereunder) shall end immediately. The number of arbitrators shall be one\nunless the Rules require otherwise.\nUnless both the Licensor and Licensee agree to the contrary: (1) All\ndocuments and information concerning the arbitration shall be public and\nmay be disclosed by any party; (2) The repository referred to under\nArticle 43 of the Rules shall make available to the public in a timely\nmanner all documents concerning the arbitration which are communicated\nto it, including all submissions of the parties, all evidence admitted\ninto the record of the proceedings, all transcripts or other recordings\nof hearings and all orders, decisions and awards of the arbitral\ntribunal, subject only to the arbitral tribunal’s powers to take such\nmeasures as may be necessary to safeguard the integrity of the arbitral\nprocess pursuant to Articles 18, 33, 41 and 42 of the Rules; and (3)\nArticle 26(6) of the Rules shall not apply.\nHuman Rights Laws. The Software shall not be used by any person\nor entity for any systems, activities, or other uses that violate any\nHuman Rights Laws. “Human Rights Laws” means any applicable laws,\nregulations, or rules (collectively, “Laws”) that protect human, civil,\nlabor, privacy, political, environmental, security, economic, due\nprocess, or similar rights; provided, however, that such Laws are\nconsistent and not in conflict with Human Rights Principles (a dispute\nover the consistency or a conflict between Laws and Human Rights\nPrinciples shall be determined by arbitration as stated above). Where\nthe Human Rights Laws of more than one jurisdiction are applicable or in\nconflict with respect to the use of the Software, the Human Rights Laws\nthat are most protective of the individuals or groups harmed shall\napply.\nIndemnity. Licensee shall hold harmless and indemnify Licensor\n(and any other contributor) against all losses, damages, liabilities,\ndeficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards,\npenalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including\nLicensor’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to\nLicensee’s use of the Software in violation of Human Rights Laws or\nHuman Rights Principles.\n\nFailure to Comply. Any failure of Licensee to act according to\nthe terms and conditions of this License is both a breach of the License\nand an infringement of the intellectual property rights of the Licensor\n(subject to exceptions under Laws, e.g., fair use). In the event of a\nbreach or infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be\nenforced by Licensor under the Laws of any jurisdiction to which\nLicensee is subject. Licensee also agrees that the Licensor may enforce\nthe terms and conditions of this License against Licensee through\nspecific performance (or similar remedy under Laws) to the extent\npermitted by Laws. For clarity, except in the event of a breach of this\nLicense, infringement, or as otherwise stated in this License, Licensor\nmay not terminate this License with Licensee.\nEnforceability and Interpretation. If any term or provision of\nthis License is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a\ncourt of competent jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality, or\nunenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this\nLicense or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in\nany other jurisdiction; provided, however, subject to a court\nmodification pursuant to the immediately following sentence, if any term\nor provision of this License pertaining to Human Rights Laws or Human\nRights Principles is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable against\nLicensee by a court of competent jurisdiction, all rights in the\nSoftware granted to Licensee shall be deemed null and void as between\nLicensor and Licensee. Upon a determination that any term or provision\nis invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, to the extent permitted by Laws,\nthe court may modify this License to affect the original purpose that\nthe Software be used in compliance with Human Rights Principles and\nHuman Rights Laws as closely as possible. The language in this License\nshall be interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or\nagainst any party.\nDisclaimer. TO THE FULL EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THIS SOFTWARE\nCOMES “AS IS,” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND LICENSOR\nAND ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANYONE FOR ANY DAMAGES\nOR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE, UNDER ANY KIND OF LEGAL CLAIM.\nThis Hippocratic License is an Ethical Source license (https://ethicalsource.dev) and is offered for use by\nlicensors and licensees at their own risk, on an “AS IS” basis, and with\nno warranties express or implied, to the maximum extent permitted by\nLaws.\n\n\n",
