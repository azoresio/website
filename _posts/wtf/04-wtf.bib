  abstract = {Many factors influence success and failure of large-scale faecal sludge and wastewater treatment projects in low-income countries. Benchmarking indicators and multicriteria analysis were adapted to define key institutional, technical and financial factors, to analyse their interrelations, and understand priorities to consider when planning and managing treatment plants. For the first time, these methods have been combined in a quantitative manner to assess planned and on-going treatment plant projects. This new methodology will aid sanitation utilities, private consultants, and funding institutions to prioritise activities and organise the operation of treatment plants.},
